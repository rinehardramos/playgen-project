## [1.01] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- **Generation engine**: wrong column reference `song_slots.hour` → `song_slots.eligible_hour` caused all playlist generation to fail
- **Generation engine**: `play_history` INSERT included non-existent `playlist_id` column, causing transaction rollback
- **Playlists page**: ISO timestamp dates (e.g. `2026-04-01T00:00:00.000Z`) not matching `YYYY-MM-DD` day keys — playlists showed `+ Generate` instead of their real status
- **Playlist detail page**: appending `T00:00:00` to an already-full ISO timestamp produced `Invalid Date` in the header
- **Login**: JWT did not include `display_name`/`email` — sidebar user info threw `toUpperCase on undefined`; fixed by persisting full user profile to `sessionStorage` on login
- **Login**: frontend expected flat `access_token` but API returns `tokens.access_token` nested object
- **Login**: `role_code` JWT claim read as `role`, causing auth checks to fail
- **API error parsing**: nested `{ error: { message } }` format not handled, showing blank error messages
- **Template builder**: fetched a non-existent `/templates/:id/slots` endpoint; slots are embedded in `GET /templates/:id`
- **Template builder**: category field name `name` → `label` to match API response
- **Song library**: `songs.filter is not a function` — API returns paginated `{ data, meta }`, not a plain array
- **Layout**: React hydration mismatch from `showNav = !!user && !isLoginPage`; changed to pathname-only check
- **Layout**: `useEffect is not defined` in Sidebar — missing import alongside `useState`
- **CORS**: nginx gateway missing `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers, blocking all browser API requests

### Added
- Per-day `+ Generate` button on each row of the playlists calendar
- Real-time status polling after generation (2 s interval, stops on terminal state)
- Generate Month progress bar showing completed / total jobs

## [1.02] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `frontend/Dockerfile` — multi-stage Next.js standalone build (deps → builder → runner)
- `frontend/.dockerignore` — excludes node_modules/.next from build context
- `frontend` Docker Compose service — frontend now runs as a container alongside the API services
- nginx `resolver 127.0.0.11` + `set $fe_upstream` — deferred DNS resolution so gateway starts before frontend without errors
- nginx catch-all `location /` — proxies all non-API traffic to the Next.js frontend container; port 80 now serves the full app
- `docker-compose.prod.yml` — production overrides: no exposed DB/Redis ports, memory limits, `restart: always`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Actions CD: triggers on version tags, SSHes into VPS, builds and redeploys
- `scripts/setup-vps.sh` — one-time Ubuntu/Debian VPS bootstrap (Docker install, deploy user, repo clone)
- `scripts/setup-ssl.sh` — Let's Encrypt SSL setup via Certbot with nginx HTTPS server block
