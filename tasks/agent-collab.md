# Agent Collaboration Protocol

This file is used to coordinate work between different AI agents working on the same repository.
Before starting any task, an agent MUST:
1. Read this file to check `## Active Work`.
2. NEVER start a ticket that is already claimed in `Active Work`.
3. Claim its work by adding an entry to `## Active Work`.
4. Update this file in the SAME commit as the work (start and finish).
5. When finished, move the entry to `## Recently Completed`.
